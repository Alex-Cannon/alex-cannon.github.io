Hi! Welcome to another post. Today I'll talk a little about FreeCodeCamp.

[FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) is a non-profit online e-learning platform for software engineers. You can learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, D3, NodeJS, and more as of writing this. The curriculum is on-going.

**I built this project to showcase my freecodecamp education.** I've built a ton of projects through freecodecamp and I wanted a centralized place to store all my challenges/projects, so I built a simple portfolio.

## > Stack
JQuery, Bootstrap, and NodeJS

My FreeCodeCamp portfolio is a static page, so there was no need for anything fancy like ReactJS.

## > Challenges
### Storing/Reading Challenges
I wanted to be able to add challenges in a simple .md file format with metadata. I also did not want to have to setup a whole database to do this!

In order to solve this issue, I used a library that read .md files to store/read/serve them from the repo.

### Code Highlighting
I wanted my code I wrote in my challenges to be highlighted. So, I used a library to do that for me!

## > Close
All in all this was a fun project. In hindsight, I should have used the .md files freecodecamp provides when you complete a challenge instead of having to do it myself.

I'm out!
