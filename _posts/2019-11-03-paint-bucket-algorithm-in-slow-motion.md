Hello! Lately I've been focusing on increasing my knowledge of algorithms and code testing. In this post,
I'll showcase a code snippet where I implement a `paint bucket` algorithm. I slowed down the algorithm so that it is clear [how the algorithm works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill#The_algorithm).

I'm using JavaScript and React to implement the algorithm. The code isn't perfect by any means, but the purpose is to showcase an interesting algorithm instead of having 100% code quality, so please don't tear it apart. Here is the live example:

<p data-height="691" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="js" data-user="Alex_Cannon" data-slug-hash="wvvyveR" style="height: 691px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Paint Bucket Algorithm In Slow Motion">
