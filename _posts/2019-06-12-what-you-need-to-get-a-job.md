Want to get a job as a Software Developmer? Great! It can be _very_ challenging to get into the industry, so I hope this blog post will help you get a job.

I'm a self-taught developer. Maybe you taught yourself, went to college, or went through a coding bootcamp. If you've started applying to jobs, you may find that getting a job is as difficult as learning to program!

The first thing you should realize about this industry is...

_The IT industry highly values **Experience**._

The more experience you can get, the better. Understandably, companies are scared of hiring developers that don't know how to code as they cost ~twice as much as regular employees. Simple, right?

_"But Alex, that's a catch-22. I can't get experience without a job." --Negative Nancy_

False! We don't give up just because people quote catch-22. The reality is this: **You can get experience without a job.** It's very simple (and I love me some simple!). Below are several ways to get experience:

1. <u>Write Software for people</u>
    * Write Software for non-profits.
        * Easy &amp; fast way to start writing software for people.
        * Flexible on deadlines.
        * Volunteer work looks great on your resume.
    * Write Software for your business.
        * You could create a business and start developing an app, website, etc. and try to make money. On your resume, you can put "Owner and Lead Software Engineer".
        * If you choose to do this, **be honest**. Don't try to decieve anyone into thinking you have more experience than you do.
        * You'll likely lose money (most businesses fail), so I recommend keeping your expenses low and focusing on getting a product out to market with as small a budget as possible.
    * Write Software for friends of friends or businesses.
        * You can network around and see if there's work you can do for a friend of a friend. I don't recommend doing business with close friends in case the deal doesn't work out.
        * You will probably have to keep your rates low as you don't have a ton of experience.
2. <u>Write Software for practice</u>
    * Tutorials don't count as practice. _Show_ people you can do better than a monkey!
    * Any software your write for practice should be a project. What do I consider a project?
        1. Must do _something_!
        2. Must be **complete!**
        3. Try to make it _different_ and _more_ impressive than other people's projects.
        4. For example, I worked with a team to clone airbnb. How many people have cloned airbnb? Not a lot. Of course we could've made our own _creative_ project that would have been _more_ different and/or impressive.

Simple, right? So, you have 2 options to get experience. **I recommend that you <u>write software for people as much as you can.</u>** Writing software for other people is simply more impressive than writing software for fun or practice.

Think about this: You're a business. Who would you pick:

A developer who...
1. Has built software for other people/businesses.
2. Has built software, that, _in theory_, should work for your business.

Now that you know **what** you need to do, you need to figure out **how** you're going to do it. Again, it's simple. **Make a Plan.**

You know yourself best. Don't plan for 5 hours a day of development when you know you're really only going to do 2. Make a plan you feel is _achievable_ and _worth_ your hard work and time.

Your plan should be [SMART](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals) and...

1. Have _daily, weekly, monthly, and annual_ goals.
2. Have a step-by-step guide on how you're going to get yourself into a position where you are writing software for people/practice.
3. Have a list of technologies you plan to learn/get more experience in. **Look at a job description for the role you're aiming for** to learn what technologies employers need you to know.
4. Be measuarable. "I want to get 20 commits this month" is measurable. "I want to do some commits this month" is not measurable.
5. Keep yourself accountable. Mayble even throw in a reward if you reach your goals. Treat yourself to a nice steak.
6. Be flexible. You may need to change bits and pieces as you go. Do it if you feel you need to.

Great! **Now you have a plan to get experienced!** Commit to it, then you'll get the experience you need. 

Now, **there are more steps you need to take to get a job** that we won't get into in this blog post. If you liked the post, feel free to request another topic by messaging me. Below are other topics I can talk about:
