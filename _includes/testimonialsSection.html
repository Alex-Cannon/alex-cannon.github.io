    <p><i>I've worked with Alex for the last year on a large scale government enterprise application.  Alex works hard and learns fast!  He's thorough and thoughtful and easy to work with.  I was the lead on the project with Alex for a year and I'd love the opportunity to work together again.  He is a smart and independent engineer who doesn't need micro-management.  I really enjoyed our code pairing sessions, Alex has a real passion for technology... <br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-ubick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">-- Chris Ubick, Lead Engineer</a></i></p>

    <p><i>Alex was an intern on the DevOps team at Ace Info the Summer of 2019. During the interview process, I was impressed with the skills he was able to learn in a short amount of time, and those skills were definitely evident during his internship. I gave him the task of assisting with our migration from Bamboo, Bitbucket, and Jenkins to Gitlab and Alex's performance was impressive. <br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-simko-82902139/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">-- Nick Simko, Lead Engineer</a></i></p>
    <p><i>Alex and I worked together on the team that built the Volunteercore opportunity tracker for the Fort Collins Volunteers of America chapter. He joined the team and immediately shrunk the product time line by building out the software front end in just a few days. The project management of the project also became more clear with Alex's help in filing clearly defined tickets, commit changes, and pull requests. Alex is highly capable in Javascript and React web development.<br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-abadie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">-- Steven Abadie, Engineer</a></i></p>
